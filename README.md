# Insructions to install PhpMyAdmin

Demonstrate how to use PhpMyAdmin with a project created from the code institute Gitpod Template.

The commands are found in `install.sh` - the file is now automatically run as part of the `init_tasks.sh` script inside the `.theia` folder. If you are interested in just install PHPMyAdmin for an existing GitPod instance, you can just copy the script over in a .sh file (and be sure to set the executable permission with `chmod -u=rwx` on the file first!).

You still need to do one manual step to configure PHPMyAdmin correctly:

To setup PHPMyAdmin for GitPod:

1. Find the file `public/phpmyadmin/config.inc.php`
2. Look for the string `AllowNoPassword`
3. Change the line to read: `$cfg['Servers'][$i]['AllowNoPassword'] = true;` and *remember to save*
4. Start apache with `apachectl start` and when the pop-up appears, click `Open Browser`
5. At the browser, add `/phpmyadmin` to the end of the URL in the address bar
6. Login with user `root` and no password.

# Creating your table in PhpMyAdmin

The primary key must be `unsigned` (under attributes), `auto increment` (check the A_I chekcbox) and the index must be `primary`

# Using the command prompt

1. Log in with `mysql -u root`

2. Switch to the database. If database not created, create with:

    `create database pet_owners`

   Once we have created, we switch using `use pet_hospital;`

3. Can use `show tables` to sell the tables.


# Using MySQL in Python

Install the requirements:

```
pip3 install pymysql
```
# To import in a database file

In terminal, in the same directory as your .sql file, type in:

```
mysql -u root < classicmodels.sql
```
